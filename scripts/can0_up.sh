# can0_up.sh — bring up the SocketCAN interface for the drivetrain SPARKs.
#
# Idempotent: safe to run when the interface is already up (it re-applies the
# config). Needs CAP_NET_ADMIN, so run as root (or via the storm-can0.service
# systemd unit).
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./can0_up.sh                 # can0 @ 1 Mbit/s
#   sudo IFACE=can1 BITRATE=500000 ./can0_up.sh
#
# restart-ms 100 enables automatic bus-off recovery: if the controller goes
# bus-off from an error storm, the kernel re-initialises it after 100 ms
# instead of leaving it dead until a manual restart.
